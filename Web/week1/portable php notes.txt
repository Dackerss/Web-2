    Open a terminal window and navigate into this repo (the web2test folder)
    Type in php-7\php.exe -S localhost:8000
    Open a web browser and point it to localhost:8000 and you should see your PHP info page
    Go back and find out where you went wrong, or give the person next to you a high five

Now you can put all your files to be tested straight into this web2test folder and you can navigate to them in the browser.

# MariaDB connection
## from built-in php server

In order to connect to a maria database, your PHP install needs to know where the driver is (needs the whole path(?)).
This is different for each person, so everyone will need to set it correctly in php.ini.

    Find the line that states the path to the extension folder (search for extension_dir)
	(Line 738 in my php.ini file)
    Change the path to match where your extension folder is (inside your php-7 folder, so in my case extension_dir = "H:\web2test\php-7\ext" because the extension directory is called ext)
